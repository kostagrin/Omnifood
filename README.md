# Simple project for my portfolio
Omnifood Project is a fictional company that provides natural food for that category of people who prefers organic food and have not enough time for cooking.
This site is built from scratch alongside during "RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN AND WEB DEVELOPMENT WITH HTML5 & CSS3" course by Jonas Schmedtmann and downloaded here, on my github repo in order to demonstrate my Front End skills.
This is a very simple responsive website which used some basics technologies of jQuery.
